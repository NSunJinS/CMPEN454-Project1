% dirstring = directory where numbered input image files are read from

% maxframenum = integer which is the frame number of the last image file in the sequence

% abs_diff_threshold = number between 0 and 255. It is the threshold called 
        %“lambda” in the lecture slide pseudocode

% alpha_parameter = floating point number between 0 and 1. It is the alpha
        % “blending” parameter for adaptive
        
% gamma_parameter = number between 0 and 255. It is the gamma “decay” parameter used in
        % the pseudocode for persistent frame differencing.
